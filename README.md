# Soli'Track - Internal Logistics Tracking Tool

Soli'Track is the internal tool I'm developing for my final Web Development diploma project. Built with Symfony, it is designed for Les Fourmis Soli’terre, a non-profit organization based in Plouasne (22), Brittany.

## About Les Fourmis Soli’terre

The organization is dedicated to solidarity and environmental protection in rural areas. They manage a recycled goods shop, giving objects a second life while fostering social connections among local residents. With the support of 35 volunteers, the shop is evolving into a community hub offering eco-friendly workshops and a café.

## Project Goals

Soli'Track aims to streamline the management of:

- Weighing incoming and outgoing items.

- Tracking sales.

- Organizing volunteer schedules.

- Providing data and statistics for the shop manager.
